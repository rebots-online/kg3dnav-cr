# Operations Log: Hybrid Knowledge Graph Sync Attempt (2025-09-27)

- Tried to reach MCP unified endpoint `http://mcp.robinsai.world:49160/health` and service host `http://mcp.robinsai.world:7474` from container.
- Both attempts failed with `Connection refused`, confirming outbound network is restricted in this environment.
- Unable to push updated architecture/checklist metadata to HKG; retained plan locally in `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE-version-build-hkg-connections-20250927-2018.md` and checklist in `docs/CHECKLISTS/` pending future sync.
- Follow-up attempt (2025-09-27 21:20 UTC) to reach Bolt endpoint `mcp.robinsai.world:7687` via `nc -z -w3` also failed (exit code 1); Bolt write-back remains blocked.
